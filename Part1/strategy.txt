Strategy: 

Server side implementation: 
1. n UDP sockets always open, for receiving requests 
2. n TCP sockets always open to send chunks 
3. n UDP sockets for broadcasting

Each thread operates a client 
Receives a request from a client 
Then calls a function "broadcast"
Broadcast sends a message to all n clients simultaneously 
Dont send ignore message from the client, client which has the packet sends it
